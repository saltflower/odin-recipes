                <li>1.5 lbs (680g) 96% lean ground beef, divided into 6x 3 oz (85g) patties</li>
                <li>3 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste (or a seasoning of your choice)</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="parts">Sauce:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the light mayo, yellow mustard, and Sriracha. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                </ol>
            <li class="parts">Burger:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>On a nonstick griddle set over high heat, smash down your two burger patties using a piece of parchment between the burger and spatula to avoid sticking. Immediately season with salt and pepper to taste or another seasoning of your choice.</li>
                    <li>After 2 minutes, flip the patties, season with salt and pepper to taste, and place a slice of American cheese on one patty. Work quickly as the low fat content of the beef may lead to dryness if overcooked.</li>
                    <li>Lightly toast the buns on the same griddle without the addition of extra fat. Alternatively you can use a toaster for a better toast.</li>
                    <li>As soon as the cheese is melted, place the other patty on top of the cheesed patty, cut the heat and prepare to assemble.</li>
                </ol>
            <li class="parts">Assembly:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spread 1 teaspoon of sauce on each side of the toasted bun.</li>
                    <li>Lay your pickles on the bottom bun followed by your burger patties and the top half of the bun. Serve and enjoy.</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>
        </ul>
